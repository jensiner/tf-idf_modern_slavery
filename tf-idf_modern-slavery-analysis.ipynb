The Future Society is a nonprofit that “help[s] society govern AI, seizing the opportunities it presents while mitigating its risks.” The organization seeks ways of using AI to read and benchmark businesses’ reports on modern slavery.  \n","\n","\n","\n","The website begins to illustrate the nature of the problem, “Years after the adoption and implementation of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act in 2010 and the UK Modern Slavery Act (MSA) in 2015, little is known about businesses’ compliance and what they have been reporting. Today there are approximately 15,000 published Modern Slavery reports and last month Australian businesses started publishing as required by the Australian Modern Slavery Act. It is imperative to innovate the process of report analysis in order to boost compliance and help combat Modern Slavery. We are looking into automating the analysis and benchmarking of existing reports.”\n","\n","\n","This project seeks to develop an approach that can summarize and gather information regarding the compliance of U.S. companies to The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. We believe that if we use TF-IDF, we could summarize different business statements and see how they compare to the requirements. Additionally, we can use TF-IDF to look for keywords to determine whether and how businesses are addressing disclosure requirements. We can also count whether the companies are addressing th five disclosure requirements.\n","\n","Taken from the website, the requirements of **[The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act](https://oag.ca.gov/SB657)** are:\n","\n","1.   Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party.\n","2.   Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit.\n","3.   Requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.\n","4.   Maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.\n","5.   Provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","## **Objective:** \n","This project seeks to...\n","- Determine whether businesses are complying with disclosure laws and \n","- How companies are combatting modern slavery based on what they disclose\n","\n","## **Method:** \n","We use NLTK and TF-IDF to meet the objectives of

We tried to avoid overfitting by having variations of the same word (having both “certification” and “certify”), or different words we think could be included to still meet requirements (“'accountability” or “procedures”). However we did look for very specific words included in the Act, so there is still a likely possibility of overfitting, however this may not be too big of a problem as the requirements are very particular and reports include similar words to the Act if they include them at all.\r\n","\r\n","### Real Life Applications\r\n","Our findings could have many other business applications. We created this to benchmark business reports on their compliance with modern slavery laws, but if there are other clear rules set for what a company needs to disclose, this method of checking what the report includes could save human resources time and energy.\r\n","\r\n","In a live system, our model can be used by government and civil society organizations to look for a company and see a summary of the report along with the specific ways in which the company addresses the five disclosure requirements. \r\n","\r\n","This will be an efficient system so that auditors, regulators, and other inspectors can quickly scan through the information provided by companies by merely looking up a given company. \r\n","\r\n","The data would live in a central website known to stakeholders so that anyone can see how different companies have set out to approach the issue of modern slavery.\r\n","\r\n","Whenever there would be new legislation, however, the model would need to be adopted to audit the new requirements. This may mean adding more keywords or enlarging the number of disclosure requirements the model checks for.\r\n","\r\n","This model will allow regulators to scan much more quickly through various reports. Currently, regulators may have to individually click on various reports and read through the summaries. This model, however, would allow regulators to scan through thousands of documents at a much more faster pace.\r\n","\r\n","### Findings\r\n","Out of the sample of 4 companies, our algorithm did not provide the correct output for 'ABB, Inc.' When we manually evaluated the website’s report using the same strategy as our algorithm, we saw that company, in fact, complied with 3 of the requirements, not 0 (as our algorithm determined). The possible reason for error could be incorrectly parsing the site because it is dynamic instead of static. Both 'ABB, Inc.' and 'ABB Motors and Mechanical Inc.' did not receive perfect scores. When we manually checked the source using our algorithm and checked for the keywords we specified, both companies met three of the required disclosure statements. However, the reports, in fact, acknowledged all of the required points, the reports just did not use the keywords that we specified, so our data was overfitted by not being inclusive of more synonyms of words or different words that would also acknowledge the same requirements. For example, for the first requirement, instead of only using variations of ‘verification’ as a keyword we could have also used ‘third-party’, for which ‘ABB Inc.’ would have met the requirement.\r\n","\r\n","Additionally, some summaries that we computed were not meaningful because of parsing errors. \r\n","\r\n","Future work may include dealing with parsing errors to handle dynamic websites and handle spam (advertisements, non-meaningful information, etc.), as well as accomodate the various words that addresses the disclosure requirements.\r\n"]}]}
